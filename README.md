This is a repository with multiple ready-to-use Infrastructure-as-Code Terraform configurations for data analysis tasks that you can deploy on AWS right away.

> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure

**Infrastructure-as-code** (IaC) has changed the world of servers for the better by eliminating manual processes, so the speed of infrastructure management is faster, trackable, replicable and more consistent since it is written in code.

Moreover, if you are a developer, it will allow you to focus on development more, while letting the software create and manage the infrastructure for you.

I find AWS to be easy to use, and it is wonderfully integrated in Terraform.

This repository is a collection of common IaC configurations for data analysis tasks.

There are very useful examples of how to **design complex infrastructures using modularity**.
They can serve as starting points that you can then customize to your own needs.

*Be careful because AWS is not free*.
